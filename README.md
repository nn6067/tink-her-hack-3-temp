### Project Description
[Sentiment driven AI companion 
An emotion aware AI chatbot that adapts its tone and responses based on a users detected mode. It integrates NLP, sentiment analysis and biometric data to provide personalised mental health support through text or voice conversations. ]

### The Problem statement
[Many people struggle with mental health challenges like stress, anxiety,  loneliness but lack immediate emotional support. Traditional therapy can be expensive and inaccessible, while existing chatbots lack real emotional awareness. ]

### The Solution
[Our solution aims to bridge this gap by creating an AI companion that can understand, adapt and respond to users emotions in real time ]
